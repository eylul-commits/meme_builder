This project is a simple meme building game written in Python. Practicing how to write tests.

*I think the function name "get_vote_count" is too vague to explain that it gets the number of votes for a specific user's contribution. I am changing it to "count_votes_for".

*I wanted to use "int" instead of "str" to respresent "voter_id" and "user_id" because treating them as numbers just makes more sense in real world applications.
